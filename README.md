# IoT-Driven Environmental Monitoring System 🌎🏢  

This project demonstrates an IoT-enabled environmental monitoring system designed for smart buildings. It uses sensors to track temperature, light, and humidity, processes data with a Go-based backend, and visualizes trends via a React.js frontend. The system enables remote control and automated energy-efficient adjustments to environmental conditions.  

## Features ✨  
- **Sensor Integration**: Simulates Wi-Fi-enabled sensors for real-time data collection.  
- **Backend**: Go server with MySQL database for data storage and automated actions.  
- **Frontend**: React.js dashboard to visualize sensor trends and manage the environment.  
- **Automation**: Triggers shading adjustments based on thresholds.  
- **Data Visualization**: Tabular representation of the latest 10 records.

## Tech Stack 🛠️  
**Backend**:  
- Go  
- MySQL  
- REST API  

**Frontend**:  
- React.js  
- Axios  

**DevOps**:  
- Docker (recommended for deployment)

## Installation 🚀  

### 1. Clone the Repository  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/your-username/environmental-monitoring-system.git  
cd environmental-monitoring-system  
```  

### 2. Setup Backend  
- Install [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install).  
- Install MySQL and set up the database:  
  ```sql  
  CREATE DATABASE iotdb;  
  USE iotdb;  

  CREATE TABLE sensor_data (  
      id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,  
      temperature FLOAT NOT NULL,  
      light FLOAT NOT NULL,  
      humidity FLOAT NOT NULL,  
      timestamp DATETIME NOT NULL  
  );  
  ```  
- Update database credentials in `main.go`.  
- Run the backend server:  
  ```bash  
  go run main.go  
  ```  

### 3. Setup Frontend  
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).  
- Navigate to the `frontend` directory:  
  ```bash  
  cd environmental-monitoring-system/frontend  
  ```  
- Install dependencies and start the app:  
  ```bash  
  npm install  
  npm start  
  ```

## Usage 💻  
1. **Start Backend**: Ensure the Go server is running on `http://localhost:8080`.  
2. **Launch Frontend**: Access the React app at `http://localhost:3000`.  
3. **View Data**: The dashboard displays the latest sensor readings and trends.

## API Endpoints 🌐  
- **POST** `/sensor-data`: Accepts new sensor data in JSON format.  
- **GET** `/get-data`: Retrieves the latest 10 sensor records.  

---

## Future Enhancements 📈  
- Integrate real IoT sensors using platforms like MQTT or AWS IoT.  
- Add user authentication for secure access.  
- Improve data visualization with graphs and real-time updates.  
- Deploy backend and frontend using cloud services for scalability.
